# 🎙️ Murf AI Voice Agent – Day 6  
**Fraud Alert Voice Agent**

This repository contains my submission for **Day 6** of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge.  
For this task, I built a voice-based **Fraud Alert Agent** that can:

- Load fake fraud cases from a sample database  
- Perform safe, basic user verification  
- Read out suspicious transaction details  
- Ask the user to confirm or deny the transaction  
- Update the fraud case status (safe / fraud / verification failed)  
- Write the final outcome back to the database  

## 📌 Current Status  
At the moment, **only the demo video has been uploaded** to this repository.

## 🔧 Coming Soon  
The following are **already completed** and will be uploaded shortly:

- Frontend implementation  
- Backend logic  
- Full project structure and documentation  

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
